Troubleshooting
===================


Using the Oscilloscope
----------------

For debugging purposes, one can look at the signals with the scope, without using the DAQ.
Needed equipment:
- Oscilloscope: located in the cabinet on the mezzanine
- Cables: 2 RG-58 cables terminated with a BNC on one side, and with a LEMO on the other side. Two of these cables are avalable next to the PM2 rack 


ConnectionError
----------------

Many errors of type:

.. code-block:: bash

	requests.exceptions.ConnectionError:

The tunnel to the AnalogDiscoveryPro digitizer is down. Re-establish the tunnel as described at the beginning of this wiki.


Flash Lamp
----------------
The flash lamp energy cannot be set to 5000 mJ.
